What is Encapsulation?
    Definition: Data hiding
    PIQ: How do you implement this OOP concept?
    1. Make all or necessary fields/attributes/variables private access modifier
    2. PUBLIC Getter and Setter methods we reach the fields and do some action (read, writing, using the field)
    3. We don't reach the fields directly, we reach through some conditions
    4. We will use this concept at Singleton Driver Concept
    5. Salary field (condition for setting the field, >0), retrive your username that you have forgatten from an application, getter method for userName might need your email
    6. CONDITION part is not necessary, depends on your code scenario

Future Topic: ENUMs

Concepts in Coding: they encounter a problem, until some genious finds a general solution

When you are learning a new topic: COnsider this question first--Why did they need to create this?
Second: Have your OWN words to describe a topic.

***** How dod you use OOP concepts in your (testing) Framework? -- Cucumber Framework

OOP Concepts we will learn:
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Abstraction
Polymorphism

** Write Only Classes
        -- Only have setter method for that field
        -- Db is write only class
** Read-ONLY Classes
        -- Only have getter nethod for that field: Credential Class UserName field is read-only, immutable (Strings) -- No mutation
        Mutation: Changing
        -- Person class is Read-Only

INHERITANCE
1. When a class inherits fields and actions of another class
2. with the extends keyword
3. Builds a "IS A" relationShip   (we also "HAS A" relationship)

What can be inherited?
- all public fields and methods
- all protected var. and meth.  --- In actual life, developers usually make the fields PROTECTED
- all default var. and meth. YES only if they are in the same package

What can NOT be inherited?
- private vars. and meth.
- constructors are not inherited, though Parent Constructor are called first with super()
    Class A(){}  --Parent
    Class B extends A(){} -- Child
    main{ B obj = new B(); first constructor of A class is called then B }
- final class can NOT be inherited
    final class ABC(){}
    NOT SAY class XYZ extends ABC

    Benefit: Reusability and Maintability

    CTRL +R or CMND+ R o easily replace code with a new one

    Normally we get Default Constructor for FREE, but if you already created a parameterized constructor, Default IS NOT FREE anymore

    Last Example:
    Parent Book Class: title, type, author, price
        - Ebook
        - PaperBook
        - AudioBook

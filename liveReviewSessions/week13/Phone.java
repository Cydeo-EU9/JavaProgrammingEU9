     /*
    Assume the existence of a Phone class that is a super class for CameraPhone class.
Define a subclass, CameraPhone that contains two instance variables: an integer named imageSize, representing the size in megapixels (for simplicity assume a pixel takes up one byte-- thus megapixels equals megabytes) of each picture (i.e., 2 means each image is composed of 2 megapixels), and an integer named memorySize, representing the number of gigabytes in the camera's memory (i.e., 4 means 4 Gigabytes of memory).
There is a constructor that accepts two integer parameters corresponding to the above two instance variables and which are used to initialize the respective instance variables.
There is also a method named numPictures that returns (as an integer) the number of pictures the camera's memory can hold. Don't forget that a gigabyte is 1,000 megabytes.

Rules about Creating Methods:

Can we create another method in a method?  NO, we can call another method

Either No Return or with some return type methods.

When you have a return type method, you HAVE to return that DataType.

A method can have same name with class name

Method overloading: same name, different parameters
changing return type is NOT method overloading

At Method OverRiding: return type has to be same or Co-variant

static keyWord is a specifier, when you put it to a method, it makes that method part of the class, you can call that method with class name

No static methods: Instance Methods --- Belongs to objects, and can be called only with object

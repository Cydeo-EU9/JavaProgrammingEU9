Requirements:
    - The app starts with printing instructions.
    - the user will select from menu some options
            - Assume if this app starts, a list object is created
            - the app will add, remove, update, search items
    - We will have a blueprint class that holds our app's functionality

    in ArrayList which method returns a negative number if the item is NOT in the arrayList?
    indexOf()


 Q1: Without creating a bluePrint class for GroceryList, what if I wanted to put everything in the main method class and make all methods static, Like printInstructions method !!!

 Q2: What if I made printInstructions in the BluePrint class, as an instance method, how can I handle scanner object?

 Inheritance: (Key element of OOP topics)


 Method Overriding !
 Is-A relationship needed. So we have two classes, that extends and inherits
 Same name, same parameters
Return Type has to be SAME or Co-Variant (What does it mean?) - Sub-Classes




 WHY we actually need it?
Because child class might need more detailed implementaion of the SAME method


 Method Overloading: Same method name with different parameters! Happens in the same class

 Method Hiding !!!!!!

 * We will pretend like we are testing a web application with custom classes we create
 * You will learn Selenium Library(dependency,tool)
* Create
    - Browser class
    - OS class
    - TestCase class will have browser and OS objects in it (HAS A relationship)
    - AppTest class extend to TestCase class (IS-A relationship)

Kadir: we should  use setter methods in paremeterized constructors if variable is private, shouldn't we ?


super keyword
super() --To call super class constructor
super. --- to cal super class methods and objects

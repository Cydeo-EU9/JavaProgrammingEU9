Java is Object Oriented Programming Language !

* Re-Usability is main concern
It means for Java what an OBJECT can reach in Coding Structure

Object Oriented:
Object what to reach and how to reach !!!!!!!
Create a relationship between code structures

Reference type decides what can be accessible. Object type decides to use most specific one.

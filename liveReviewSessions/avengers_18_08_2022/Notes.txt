Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
 int num = new Scanner(System.in).nextInt();

 When we use new keyword we create an object

 new Scanner(System.in) this statement is no different writing object reference

 When we create custom class and from classes we create objects

 What is the reason of creating objects from custom classes?
 - to reach methods and fields of that custom class

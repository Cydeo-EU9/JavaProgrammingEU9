OutOfMemoryError: heap memory is full



Exceptions: unexpected or unwanted events

		Unchecked (unexpected event): occurs during the runtime

					all the RuntimeExceptions are unchecked exceptions

		checked (unwanted event): occurs during the compile time

					all the exceptions that are not RuntimeExceptions are checked exception



Exception handlings:
		
		1. Try & Catch blocks: used for handling checked and unchecked exceptions

						try{

							exception code

						}catch(ExceptionClass  e){

							e.printStackTrace();

						}


			Multi-catch block: parent exception type can not be placed before the child exception type

			finally block: always gets executed regardless of the exception is being handled or not handled

							to stop the execution of the finally block: Syste.exit(0)

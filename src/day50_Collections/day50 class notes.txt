Collections Framework: consists of multiple interface, each interface is implemented by classes
	
	Collection (I): dynamic sized
					ready methods	
					for non-primitives ONLY

					extended by List, Set, Queue

				List (I): duplicates are allowed, has index number

						ArrayList (C): searching/accessing elements is faster.

						LinkedList (C): insertion /deletion of the element is faster

						Vector (C): is Synhcronized ==> thread-safe

						Stack (C): is Synhcronized ==> thread-safe. LIFO

								pop() ===> LIFO


				Set (I): duplicates are not allowed, does not have index number

						HashSet (C): Maintains random order. Fastest

						LinkedHashSet (C): Maintains insertion order

						TreeSet (C): Maintains sorted order, does not accept null


				Queue (I): duplicates are allowed, does not have index number. FIFO

							poll() ===> FIFO

						PriorityQueue (C): Maintains random order


						ArrayDequeue (C): Maintains insertion order


						LinkedList (C): Maintains insertion order
